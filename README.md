# Exploring the Causal Effect of Serum Zinc Levels on Risk of Type 1 Diabetes: A Mendelian Randomization Study

# Project description
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical method that aims to establish causal relationships between a risk factor and an outcome. This project uses MR to investigate the causal effect of serum zinc levels on risk of Type 1 diabetes mellitus using genetic variants from Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

R programming language (version 3.5 or later)
RStudio (version 1.2 or later)
Required R packages (listed in the requirements.R file)
Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open RStudio and set the working directory to the cloned repository.
Install the required packages by running source("requirements.R").
Data
This project uses publicly available genetic data from the UK Biobank. The data can be obtained from the UK Biobank website (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).

Running the Analysis
Open the analysis.Rmd file in RStudio.
Knit the file to generate the analysis report (analysis.html).
View the report to see the results of the MR analysis.
