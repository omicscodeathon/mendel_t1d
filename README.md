# Exploring the Causal Effect of Serum Zinc Levels on Risk of Type 1 Diabetes: A Mendelian Randomization Study








## Project description
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical method that aims to establish causal relationships between a risk factor and an outcome. This project uses MR to investigate the causal effect of serum zinc levels on risk of Type 1 diabetes mellitus using genetic variants from Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

* R software (version 4.0 or later)
* RStudio (version 1.2 or later)
* R packages
  * TwoSampleMR version 0.5.6 
  * plyr 

## Installing
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open RStudio and set the working directory to the cloned repository.
* Install the required packages by running "install.packages('plyr', repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
remotes::install_github("MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR")".

## Data
This project uses publicly available genetic data from the IEU OpenGWAS project. The data can be obtained from the OpenGWAS website (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/) using the dataset IDs indicated in the R script (mr_T1d.R).

## Running the Analysis
* Open the mr_T1d.Rmd file in RStudio.
* Knit the file to generate the analysis report (mr_T1d.html).
* View the report to see the results of the MR analysis.
